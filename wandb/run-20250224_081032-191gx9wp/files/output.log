Initiating Fine-Tuning for the model on our dataset
Truncation was not explicitly activated but `max_length` is provided a specific value, please use `truncation=True` to explicitly truncate examples to max length. Defaulting to 'longest_first' truncation strategy. If you encode pairs of sequences (GLUE-style) with the tokenizer you can select this strategy more precisely by providing a specific strategy to `truncation`.
C:\Users\a.frost\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Lib\site-packages\transformers\tokenization_utils_base.py:2673: FutureWarning: The `pad_to_max_length` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future version, use `padding=True` or `padding='longest'` to pad to the longest sequence in the batch, or use `padding='max_length'` to pad to a max length. In this case, you can give a specific length with `max_length` (e.g. `max_length=45`) or leave max_length to None to pad to the maximal input size of the model (e.g. 512 for Bert).
  warnings.warn(
Passing a tuple of `past_key_values` is deprecated and will be removed in Transformers v4.48.0. You should pass an instance of `EncoderDecoderCache` instead, e.g. `past_key_values=EncoderDecoderCache.from_legacy_cache(past_key_values)`.
